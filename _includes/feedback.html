            <p>“Sue has done a fantastic job of our little man! By far the best he's been groomed ever! He was a little scaredy cat to begin with but Sue was able to calm him down and work with him to produce an amazing cut! I highly recommend. You can never stop grooming now Sue as you've got us for life.”</p>
